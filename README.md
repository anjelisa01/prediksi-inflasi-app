# 📈 Inflation Prediction App
Final Year College Project – A web-based inflation prediction tool powered by Multiple Linear Regression, built to provide accessible and interactive forecasting through a simple web interface.

# 🔍 Overview
This project was developed as part of my final year undergraduate coursework. It aimed to demonstrate the use of machine learning for economic forecasting, specifically predicting inflation rates based on historical economic indicators.

The app was built using Streamlit for the frontend and connected to a database to allow authorized users to perform full CRUD operations on the dataset. It provided a smooth and interactive experience for both casual users and data managers.

## 🚀 Features
📊 Inflation Forecasting using Multiple Linear Regression

🧮 Clean and minimal Streamlit-based web UI

🔐 Authenticated CRUD access to manage dataset entries

💾 Backed by a persistent database 

✅ Ideal for educational use or as a lightweight forecasting tool

## 🛠 Tech Stack
Python

Streamlit

scikit-learn

pandas

MySQL

User Authentication Layer

## 📦 Deployment
Note: This app was originally deployed and accessible online, but the deployment is currently offline due to hardware failure (the development laptop is no longer functional).

While the app is not currently online, the project can be restored or rebuilt with the existing code and database schema, provided backups are available.

## 🗃 Project Status
⛔ Currently Offline

## 📚 Educational Value
Despite being offline, this project showcases:

Solid application of machine learning for real-world problems.

Integration of data science with web deployment.

Best practices for creating end-to-end ML web applications.
